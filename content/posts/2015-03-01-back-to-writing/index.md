I haven't updated this blog since I joined thoughtbot in 2012. This was due to a combination of not having the time to do proper research outside working hours and finding [better][robots] [venues][smashing] for technical writing.

Given how tiny my blog audience got over the last three years, I considered moving to Medium as a way to grow my readership though social connections. But that idea didn't last long; no amount of perks can convince me to write on a closed platform where I can't affect neither the writing nor the reading experience.

In the end, I decided to move the old content from `kaishinlab.com` to this blog and set up redirects when necessary---a prime example of the freedom you unlock when you have control over you data.

It feels good to be back.
