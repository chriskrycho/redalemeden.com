I haven't updated this blog since I joined thoughtbot in 2012. This was due to a combination of lacking the time to do proper research outside working hours and finding [better][robots] [venues][smashing] for technical writing. I was convinced that it's better to spend my time fixing things rather than writing about it. But as time went on, I started to realize that writing about something is the best way to get it out of your system and move on to the next thing.

Given how tiny my blog audience got over the last 3 years, I considered moving to Medium as a way to grow my readership though social connections. But that idea didn't last long; no amount of perks can convince me to write on a closed platform where I can't affect neither the writing nor the reading experience.

In the end, I decided to move the old content from `kaishinlab.com` to this blog and set up redirects when necessary---a prime example of the freedom you unlock when you have control over you data.

It feels good to be back.
