If we were to represent the hierarchy of our refactoring itches as a pyramid, eliminating duplication would be at the very bottom. The DRY principle, as it is often referred to, is the uncontested cornerstone of good development practices.

SwiftUI, as new and unpolished as it is, already exposes some powerful APIs for that end. I’ve been using view extensions, view modifiers, and preference keys so far with great success. If you’re looking to learn more about these largely undocumented capabilities, look no further than these two fresh posts:
