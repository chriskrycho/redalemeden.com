Starting next week I will be helping [Hyper Island](https://www.hyperisland.com) students take their first step into the world of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am pretty excited about this opportunity to share my passion for the Web, and I hope that by introducing them to the basic building blocks I can help them see the forest for the trees.
