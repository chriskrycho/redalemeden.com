As I started work on the next iteration of the site, I realized that I need to reconsider certain content-related aspects. For instance, I have been exclusively using this microblog for the past year or so, all but abandoning the main blog. One obvious change I could begin with is moving _This Week I Learned_ entries over to the blog or even splitting them into their own thing altogether.
