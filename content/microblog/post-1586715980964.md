Here are some of the things I learnt this week, in the order I've noted them down:

* _Calm technology_. A term coined by PARC researcher Mark Weiser in 1995, referring to technology that does not seek to become the center of attention when we use it. Itâ€™s there when we need it, and out of sight when we donâ€™t. More on the topic [here](https://calmtech.com/index.html).

* _Eggcorn_. A phrase or expression that resulted from intentionally or accidentally substituting one or more words from an expression with similar-sounding words ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eggcorn)). For example:
  * _Praying mantis_ -> _preying mantis_.
  * _Cut to the chase_ -> _cut to the cheese_.
  * _Acorn_ -> _eggcorn_ (duh).

* The entire [ACM Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org) is free to access until June 30th. There's more to COVID-19 quarantine than Netflix ðŸ˜‰.
