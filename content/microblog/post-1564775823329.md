title: "Undocumented View Preference Changes in Beta 5"
tags:

I haven’t seen this mentioned anywhere,
but the [`onPreferenceChange(_:perform:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/anyview/3264105-onpreferencechange#) view instance method now requires the preference key value type to conform to `Equatabale` as of Beta 5.

In practice, this means that `oPreferenceChange` can no longer be used with preference keys that have an `Anchor<Value>` as their value type or a as a property of their value type,
since `Anchor` itself doesn’t conform to `Equatable`.
I fixed this by passing the `GeometryProxy` instance to a custom view modifier that unpacks the anchor first using the provided proxy,
then passes the result as a `CGFloat` instead.
